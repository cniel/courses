définition galectine :

NCBI chapter 33:
Galectins typically bind β-galactose-containing glycoconjugates 
and share primary structural homology in their carbohydrate-recognition domains (CRDs). 
Previously termed S-type lectins, 
galectins represent a group of proteins that are the most widely expressed class of lectins in all organisms. 
This chapter describes the diversity of the galectin family and presents an overview of what is known about their biosynthesis, secretion, and biological activities.

It was originally described in 1975 during studies on the possible presence of lectins in the electric organs of the electric eel.


UNIPROT :
Fonction: 
	May regulate apoptosis, cell proliferation and cell differentiation. 
	Binds beta-galactoside and a wide array of complex carbohydrates. 
	Inhibits CD45 protein phosphatase activity and therefore the dephosphorylation of Lyn kinase.

Tissue expression : 
	Expressed in placenta, maternal decidua and fetal membranes. 
	Within placenta, expressed in trophoblasts, stromal cells, villous endothelium, syncytiotrophoblast apical membrane and villous stroma. 
	Within fetal membranes, expressed in amnion, chorioamniotic mesenchyma and chorion (at protein level). 
	Expressed in cardiac, smooth, and skeletal muscle, neurons, thymus, kidney and hematopoietic cells.

WIKIPEDIA:
Apoptosis:
	can regulate cell death both intracellularly and extracellularly.
	Extracellularly, they cross link glycans on the outside of cells and transduce signals across the membrane to directly cause cell death or activate downstream signalling that triggers apoptosis.
	Intracellularly, they can directly regulate proteins that control cell fate (destinée cellulaire).
	Some ways to regulate apoptosis:
		 To control positive and negative selection of T cells in the thymus. Both galectin-1 and galectin-9 are secreted by epithelial cells in the thymus and mediate T cell apoptosis. Galectin-1 binds many proteins on the T cell surface, but specifically CD7, CD43 and CD45 are involved in apoptosis.
		 Galectin-7 may have a key role in regulating apoptosis of keratinocytes after DNA damage, such as that caused by UV radiation.
